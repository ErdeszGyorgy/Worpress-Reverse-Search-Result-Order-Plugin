# Worpress-Reverse-Search-Result-Order-Plugin
Reverses the order of search results to show the oldest posts first.

In case you want to see the posts of an archive page of a month chronologically, starting with the oldest post (like the first day of the month or so) first.

Put the php file into a folder named like "reverse-search-order", upload it with the folder into the "/wp-content/plugins" directory and activate the plugin on the admin page.
